# Path Finding Visualizer

An interactive web application for visualizing path-finding algorithms in action. This project helps users understand how different path-finding algorithms work through intuitive visualization and animation.

## Features

- Multiple path-finding algorithms including Dijkstra's algorithm
- Interactive grid where users can:
  - Draw/erase walls by clicking and dragging
  - Move source and target points
  - Generate random mazes
- Adjustable visualization settings:
  - Grid cell size (Small/Medium/Large)
  - Animation speed (Slow/Normal/Fast)
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Detailed algorithm explanations
- Interactive tutorial for new users
